# Time series forecasting
Companies investing in ads on Wikipedia pages of different languages want to reduce ad costs and get maximum viewership. I forecasted views on ads in 6 languages using time series techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA and Prophet library. English page ads were found to have the most viewers which had 5.67% Mean Absolute Percentage Error using Prophet.
